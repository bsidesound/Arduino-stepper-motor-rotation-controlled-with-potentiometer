# Arduino-stepper-motor-rotation-controlled-with-potentiometer
Here I control the rotation of a Mitsumi M42SP-5 stepper motor (50 ohm) with a potentiometer, using an Arduino Uno. Since the motor needs 12V to work, a ULN2003A darlington array is used. The code is not based on the stepper Arduino library.
